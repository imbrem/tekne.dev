I woke up, and the hosts treated me to a wonderful breakfast. Then I headed to the supermarket to
buy some toothpaste and a toothbrush; I tried to buy gas too, but my debit card doesn't seem to be
working, and they use those auto-pumps here which need you to insert a card before they dispense. I
see problems on my horizon...

Time for a little change of pace: we need to sit down and figure out what our next stop is on the
way to Termini Imerese, and we need to get some progress in on our [TOPLAS
paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09347)'s
[revisions](https://github.com/isotope-project/ssa-densem/). Let's start with travel planning. We've
got about 2400 kilometers to go, and a solid 24 hours of driving. The question is where to stop. I
saw some hotels in Dijon, but it's a litle close (I want to get 8 hours of riding or so in today),
and I need to evaluate it for motorcycle safety. Otherwise, we'll need to enter Switzerland.
So let's look!

It seems all the hotels near Switzerland are quite expensive. It's a 9 hour ride to get to Milan
otherwise; doable, but there are certain to be delays, and arriving at midnight will be painful.
So... we can stay in a hostel and face a 17 hour drive from there. Or go to the ibis in Milan and
face a 14 hour drive, but we need to brave the alps. And the ibis is cheaper. But we'll be driving
all day... If we have 3 hours of rest, we'll get there by 1 AM...

Alright... let's ride hard, but to the Idea Hotel Milano. Let me just check about the parking...

Well, they're not answering. Going to buy my [vignette](https://via.admin.ch/shop/) (the site is
surprisingly hard to find) online. Now we need to check if they'll allow us to check in at 1 AM, and
then, off we go... oh, and I need to fill up my chargebank! Hmm... difficult choices.

Let me also research Italian tolls...

Seems fine. Maybe going to adjust my clutch a tiny bit more too, because I fear it being too tight
for a day of very hard riding. Yeah. I'm impulsive... I just want to check about the tunnels.

Alright. Let's just do it, then. This will be !!FUN!!, in the Dwarf Fortress sense.

We'll get back to the type theory tomorrow, I guess!

2025-08-24T12:57+2. Forth and onwards!
