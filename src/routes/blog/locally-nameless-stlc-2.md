(WET lore:)

(theorem: derivations are subsingletons)

(segue)

(so: WET var)

(so: WET derivations)

(so: pulldown lore about uniqueness, lc)

(todo: should there be a macro for this?)

(todo: in fact, we can actually _infer_ derivations here, by decidability. so that's another path)

(trivia:)

(theorem: uniqueness of typing)

(theorem: well-scopedness)

(work:)

(theorem: weakening)

(theorem: unary substitution)

(approaches to $n$-ary substitution: functional, finitely supported derivation)

($n$-ary substitution _composes_)

(2.5 paths from here)

(reduction lore)

(categorical lore)

(go add coproducts)

(covalence work:)

(kernel data structures)

(thesis work:)

(write some text)

(LC SSA expr typing, let₂ lore (just use disjoint name bundles from below, is nicer...))

(Question: should _everyone_ use disjoint name bundles, or just $n$-aries?)

(LC SSA regions)

(LC SSA region typing; disjoint name bundle lore)

(scraping work:)

(basic schema)

(nested parse pipeline)

(sql lore)

(row hash as foreign key?)
