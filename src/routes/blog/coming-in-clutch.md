title: Adventures in Type Theory 2 — Coming in Clutch
published: '2025-08-25'
---

So, this entry in _Adventures in Type Theory_ has decidedly less type theory, but _not none_. That
is because my freshly installed clutch has decided to give in; it turns out that it was installed
incorrectly. 

Riding with a slipping clutch is painful, and so we'll be spending the next day or two here in
Alsace while we await repairs at [Seedz
Motorsport](https://www.facebook.com/people/Seedz-Motorsport/100028842297131/), who have been
absolutely wonderful in helping me get back on the road! Until then, _hopefully_, we'll have time to
do a bit more type theory.

Without further ado, here's the story so far!

# Initialization

_Location_: [L'Emanuella](https://www.lemmanuella.fr/), Isbergues (50.61313, 2.45165)

_Time_: 2025-08-24T11:49+2

I woke up, and the hosts treated me to a wonderful breakfast.

</div>

Then I headed to the supermarket to buy some toothpaste and a toothbrush; I tried to buy gas too,
but my (Starling) debit card was not accepted, and they use those auto-pumps here which need you to
insert a card before they dispense. I left my other cards at l'Emmanuella.

I see problems on my horizon...

_Narrator: there were problems on the horizon_

It was time for a little change of pace: we needed to: 
- Sit down and figure out what our next stop is on the way to Termini Imerese 
- Get some progress in on our [TOPLAS paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09347)'s
[revisions](https://github.com/isotope-project/ssa-densem/). 

There were two primary options for travel:
- Make for Dijon, and cross the Alps the next day
- Make for Milan, and demonstrate the will of an iron donkey by travelling 1000 kilometers in a day

The latter wouldn't leave much time for type theory... but I wanted to spend more time in Italy,
rather than travelling. And all the hotels in the middle ground, namely Switzerland, were painfully
expensive.

So, the impulse took hold of me, and I spent the next hour preparing for the long haul to Milan.

- I bought an [e-vignette](https://via.admin.ch/shop/) for riding through Switzerland. The official
  site was suprisingly hard to find through search!
- I made an ill-fated reservation at the [Idea Hotel Milano San Siro](https://sansiro.ideahotel.it/)

Allocating 3 hours time for rest, and pushing the Gladius to the limit, we could make it by 1 AM. So
be it.

A little moment of research, putting it off, like when there's a heavy weight on the bar and you
just don't want to lift it. I'm regretting having taken so much time to get started; if I had
started right away, we could have made it by 11!

Alright. This will be !!FUN!!, in the Dwarf Fortress sense.

2025-08-24T12:57+2. Forth and onwards!

# The Path to Milan

We're off to a good start. In the exceedingly brief age of the Z650, that liminal space between
defeats, a good friend of mine and fellow category theorist implored me to get a windshield,
complaining of the windblast from the naked bike.

I responded with, essentially, _do u even lift, bro?_.

Well, look who has egg on their face now. Well, insects, actually. I'm sure they carry eggs.

We're off to a roaring start, and I'm getting a real core workout fighting the windblast. I try
various positions, and find that sitting upright I need to either use my arms or engage my core and
legs, whereas leaning forwards is more in the legs and head. 

The strength of the blast is highly nonlinear, so it's quite relaxing when I'm behind cars just
cruising, but becomes a serious exertion when speeding past in the fast lane, so much so that I
occasionally stop in the slow lane for a rest. I didn't realize how bad it was before, because it's
my first really long trip on the Gladius, and I tend to go slower on UK roads. Every bit counts!

I stop for gas and a snack. My credit cards, which are on my phone, are not accepted by the gas pump
(but work inside for food!). My other debit card is. After a slight delay, I ride off, but quickly
notice, _elas_, my clutch is slipping once more. The free play at the clutch lever has disappeared,
so I pull over to the side of the highway and adjust it once more.

<div style="text-align: center">

</div>

<div style="text-align: center">
<img src={ready_to_ride} alt="Ready to ride off post-adjustment!" style="max-width: 70%" />
</div>

The ride carries on, we get some more gas, and... it's slipping again! Again, the free play is
mostly gone, so we adjust further... There are also nice windmills on the side of the road.

<div style="text-align: center">
<img src={windmills} alt="Windmills on the side of the road, during the second clutch adjustment" style="max-width: 70%" />
</div>

The ride carries on. Clutch is holding just fine. I test it a few times, and even on 6th gear
lugging it, the RPM is directly proportional to the speed.

I get some more gas. Can you guess what happened? Yeah.

So I'm stopped at the toll gate, and begin trying to figure out what's wrong. There's no more room
to adjust at the handlebar. I take off the sprocket cover to take a look at the arm, with the help
of my trusty mechanic, ChatGPT, who hopes that it's just the cable being worn.

(TODO: clutch arm photo goes here)

During this kerfuffle, I drop the bike. The bike is fine, but the left mirror takes a hit and needs
to be straightened, and, more irritatingly, my only charge bank breaks. Up to this point, I was
riding with the cable in my pocket, which surprisingly can handle the high speeds, since my
[navigation phone](https://amzn.eu/d/dhEAsxq) has limited battery capacity.

(TODO: riding configuration photo goes here)

A friendly biker on a Z900 stops by, and we take a look together. The arm is resting firmly on the
stop. It seems that, once more, my freshly installed clutch is cooked.

So.

We continue the ride eastwards, now with a slipping clutch. We're limited to about 110 km/h, usually
below 100, before the clutch stops biting. Stop and get some gas, spend a bit too long resting. 

The scenery is beautiful, though, and I wish I had brought a GoPro. Low RPM, low throttle, high
gear, lower on slopes, which get more common as we head further east. I gaze upon the great works of
man, 5% and 6% grades carved up and down the rolling hills. 

Stop for gas again at Kekastel, and realize, as it's approaching 10 PM, that it's time to call it a
night. Find a motel nearby, [hotelF1 Saverne Monswiller](https://maps.app.goo.gl/uNd1P9ximyjQRb788).
About 35 kilometers left, then, our ride cut short to 475 km. 

The cold begins to set in.

At one point, the road split into two levels, and it looked quite striking at night. I could only
find a Google Streetview image taken during the day:

<div style="text-align: center">
<img src={streetview_levels} alt="The road from Kekastel to Sarreguemines, split into two levels as it goes through the hills" style="max-width: 70%" />
</div>

None of these roads are, individually, _bona fide_ megaprojects, and yet, I am always awestruck at
the immense labor it must have required to build these structures _in totality_. There is something
larger-than-life, _cyclopean_, about highways, sized as they are for cars rather than men.

*They carved hills as hunters carve beast-flesh. Wild Men think they ate stone for food. They went
through Druádan to Rimmon with great wains. They go no longer.* - Ghân-buri-Ghân, _The Return of the
King_

And yet we are on those roads. We are those people. But I digress.

We arrive. The room is spare, but standard.

(TODO: room photo?)

I debate writing this post, but hypersleep beckons.

I quickly check my bank balance, on both cards. The second is... _almost empty_.

Huh?

Turns out each gas station was reserving up to _500 €_ to pump gas. And I pumped gas often, for
safety, and to take a rest from the road, sometimes as little as 4 liters at a time. 

Let's hope they let go of that quickly, as otherwise, we will need to look for gas stations with
attendants, which seem rare out here. Like I said, Problems™.

(EDIT: one hold was removed by around 2025-08-25T15:30+2; the others, so far, remain)

# Repair in Sarreguemines

_Location_: [hotelF1 Saverne Monswiller](https://maps.app.goo.gl/uNd1P9ximyjQRb788) (48.75137,
7.38435)

_Time_: 2025-08-25T10:30+2

I sleep through my alarms, and achieve consciousness at 10:30 AM, 30 minutes before checkout time.
Put on some electronic metal to time myself, and get out just in time, having double-checked that I
didn't leave anything in the room.

I get downstairs, and call around to see where I can get my bike repaired. Lots of bad luck, little
in the way of English speakers. While I am nominally fluent in French, this is one _fun_ way to
practice my motorcycle jargon, especially since just yesterday I learned that "my clutch is
slipping" is translated "mon embrayage patine." I just typed in "engage." As I was saying.

Even more fun was calling shops down in Milan, who primarily spoke Italian. I got in touch with one
guy who spoke English, after much Google-translate-fu, over at [Japanmoto
Milano](https://japanmoto.it/), who was very helpful. He could probably get me a new Suzuki clutch.
But would I want to brave the Alps that day, and get the clutch repaired tomorrow, pre-ordering it?
That's what would be necessary to make the schedule.

At this point, I had called a local garage, I believe it was [Magic
Racing](https://maps.app.goo.gl/BkhQB6fmHnQF8JXM9), which was very nice, but couldn't help me
because they didn't do road bikes. Thankfully, they called [Seedz
Motorsport](https://www.facebook.com/people/Seedz-Motorsport/100028842297131/) for me, who later
called me back, on my UK number no less, as my French phone had run out of battery.

They can fix the clutch, worst case by the day after tomorrow morning (2025-08-27), best case
tomorrow evening (2025-08-26).

So.

Naturally, I book the [ferry from Genoa to
Palermo](https://www.gnv.it/en/ferries-destinations/sicily/genoa-palermo) departing
2025-08-28T22:45+2. As I'm booking, I catch sight of an... interesting... advertisement.

(TODO: foreign legion ad)

We ride to [Seedz](https://www.facebook.com/people/Seedz-Motorsport/100028842297131/), arriving just
as they open at 2025-08-25T14:00+2, and they take a quick look. The staff is extremely nice, and let
me watch as they open up the sprocket cover. Lots of cool bikes around, too, in various states of
disassembly. 

Seems the clutch cable is fine, which means they have to open the clutch itself. But later, as they
have another bike scheduled. I go get a coffee and a croissant at the [nearby
patisserie](https://maps.app.goo.gl/Ky85BSdFnAwzvKKT7), and start writing.

(TODO: photo here)

I finally get a bit of work in on my TOPLAS revisions: I start [removing effect annotations from
contexts](https://github.com/isotope-project/ssa-densem/commit/e7f56c3e42fdbb87e78ea52ace8ebf355e058d3f),
to simplify the narrative. During the ride, I had some inspiration about how to do SSA in locally
nameless style. Excited to start experimenting with that.

I head back to the shop, and the clutch is indeed cooked. I had _just_ gotten a new one installed at
[Cambridge Motorcycles](https://www.cambridgemotorcycles.co.uk/), and apparently, it was done
incorrectly, with the plates in the wrong order and the springs far too soft. An oil cable was also
disconnected, and half the coolant was missing. So that's why there was that misting of oil on the
engine case. _No bueno_.

Thankfully, they can get the parts in, hopefully even by tomorrow, as planned, and we can ride off.
I book accomodation at [Alternative Hôtel Proche
Sarreguemines](https://maps.app.goo.gl/4DoHT8c4oCsihPU17), which I walk to, and the room is
_beautiful_.

(TODO: room photo)

They've even got this nice intro to the hotel, along with a little guide to the local area!

(TODO: guide photo)

It's really great. It's amazing what happens when people _care_.

I then walk to go get some food. And some more coffee. The river ever calls my kind, and I find
myself at [Kebab Le Bosphore](https://maps.app.goo.gl/BZDovZ6r6yfJkxV49), writing this up.

(TODO: writeup photo)

And eating...

(TODO: food photo)

Until next time!
