title: Adventures in Type Theory 2 — Coming in Clutch
published: '2025-08-25'
---

So, this entry in _Adventures in Type Theory_ has decidedly less type theory, but _not none_. That
is because my freshly installed clutch has decided to give in; it turns out that it was installed
incorrectly. 

Riding with a slipping clutch is painful, and so we'll be spending the next day or two here in
Alsace while we await repairs at [Seedz
Motorsport](https://www.facebook.com/people/Seedz-Motorsport/100028842297131/), who have been
absolutely wonderful in helping me get back on the road! Until then, _hopefully_, we'll have time to
do a bit more type theory.

Without further ado, here's the story so far!

# Initialization

_Location_: [L'Emanuella](https://www.lemmanuella.fr/), Isbergues (50.61313, 2.45165)

_Time_: 2025-08-24T11:49+2

I woke up, and the hosts treated me to a wonderful breakfast.

</div>

Then I headed to the supermarket to buy some toothpaste and a toothbrush; I tried to buy gas too,
but my (Starling) debit card was not accepted, and they use those auto-pumps here which need you to
insert a card before they dispense. I left my other cards at l'Emmanuella.

I see problems on my horizon...

_Narrator: there were problems on the horizon_

It was time for a little change of pace: we needed to: 
- Sit down and figure out what our next stop is on the way to Termini Imerese 
- Get some progress in on our [TOPLAS paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09347)'s
[revisions](https://github.com/isotope-project/ssa-densem/). 

There were two primary options for travel:
- Make for Dijon, and cross the Alps the next day
- Make for Milan, and demonstrate the will of an iron donkey by travelling 1000 kilometers in a day

The latter wouldn't leave much time for type theory... but I wanted to spend more time in Italy,
rather than travelling. And all the hotels in the middle ground, namely Switzerland, were painfully
expensive.

So, the impulse took hold of me, and I spent the next hour preparing for the long haul to Milan.

- I bought an [e-vignette](https://via.admin.ch/shop/) for riding through Switzerland. The official
  site was suprisingly hard to find through search!
- I made an ill-fated reservation at the [Idea Hotel Milano San Siro](https://sansiro.ideahotel.it/)

Allocating 3 hours time for rest, and pushing the Gladius to the limit, we could make it by 1 AM. So
be it.

A little moment of research, putting it off, like when there's a heavy weight on the bar and you
just don't want to lift it. I'm regretting having taken so much time to get started; if I had
started right away, we could have made it by 11!

Alright. This will be !!FUN!!, in the Dwarf Fortress sense.

2025-08-24T12:57+2. Forth and onwards!

# The Path to Milan

We're off to a good start. In the exceedingly brief age of the Z650, that liminal space between
defeats, a good friend of mine and fellow category theorist implored me to get a windshield,
complaining of the windblast from the naked bike.

I responded with, essentially, _do u even lift, bro?_.

Well, look who has egg on their face now. Well, insects, actually. I'm sure they carry eggs.

We're off to a roaring start, and I'm getting a real core workout fighting the windblast. I try
various positions, and find that sitting upright I need to either use my arms or engage my core and
legs, whereas leaning forwards is more in the legs and head. 

The strength of the blast is highly nonlinear, so it's quite relaxing when I'm behind cars just
cruising, but becomes a serious exertion when speeding past in the fast lane, so much so that I
occasionally stop in the slow lane for a rest. I didn't realize how bad it was before, because it's
my first really long trip on the Gladius, and I tend to go slower on UK roads. Every bit counts!

I stop for gas and a snack. My credit cards, which are on my phone, are not accepted by the gas pump
(but work inside for food!). My other debit card is. After a slight delay, I ride off, but quickly
notice, _elas_, my clutch is slipping once more. The free play at the clutch lever has disappeared,
so I pull over to the side of the highway and adjust it once more.

</div>

<div style="text-align: center">

</div>

The ride carries on, we get some more gas, and... it's slipping again! Again, the free play is
mostly gone, so we adjust further... There are also nice windmills on the side of the road.

<div style="text-align: center">
<img src={windmills} alt="Windmills on the side of the road, during the second clutch adjustment" style="max-width: 70%" />
</div>

The ride carries on. Clutch is holding just fine. I test it a few times, and even on 6th gear
lugging it, the RPM is directly proportional to the speed.

I get some more gas. Can you guess what happened? Yeah.

So I'm stopped at the toll gate, and begin trying to figure out what's wrong. There's no more room
to adjust at the handlebar. I take off the sprocket cover to take a look at the arm, with the help
of my trusty mechanic, ChatGPT, who hopes that it's just the cable being worn.

(TODO: clutch arm photo goes here)

A friendly biker on a Z900 stops by, and we take a look together. The arm is resting firmly on the
stop. It seems that, once more, my freshly installed clutch is cooked.

So.

We continue the ride eastwards, now with a slipping clutch. We're limited to about 110 km/h, usually
below 100, before the clutch stops biting. Stop and get some gas, spend a bit too long resting. 

The scenery is beautiful, though, and I wish I had brought a GoPro. Low RPM, low throttle, high
gear, lower on slopes, which get more common as we head further east. I gaze upon the great works of
man, 5% and 6% grades carved up and down the rolling hills. 

Stop for gas again at Kekastel, and realize, as it's approaching 10 PM, that it's time to call it a
night. Find a motel nearby, Hotel F1 (TODO: link)

At one point, the road split into two levels, and it looked quite striking at night. I could only
find a Google Streetview image taken during the day:

<div style="text-align: center">
<img src={streetview_levels} alt="The road from Kekastel to Sarreguemines, split into two levels as it goes through the hills" style="max-width: 70%" />
</div>

None of these roads are _bona fide_ megaprojects, and yet, I am always awestruck at the immense
labor it must have required to build these structures _in totality_. There is something
larger-than-life, _cyclopean_, about highways, sized as they are for cars rather than men.

*They carved hills as hunters carve beast-flesh. Wild Men think they ate stone for food. They went
through Druádan to Rimmon with great wains. They go no longer.* - Ghân-buri-Ghân, _The Return of the
King_

And yet we are on those roads. We are those people. But I digress.
