It's been a long journey!

We set sail from [Termini Imerese](https://maps.app.goo.gl/9CGy7299J77gDpKF6) to the island of
[Vulcano](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vulcano) [^1]. Well, we sailed part of the way, but after making
the mistake of letting me at the wheel, we had to switch to the engine...

</div>

Anyways. From there, we move on to the island of [Lipari](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipari),
where we part ways, with the rest of the crew going to
[Stromboli](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stromboli). It was time to get somewhere with better
Internet.

I took the ferry back to [Messina](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Messina), and from there, the train
back to Termini Imerese. On the long march to the train station, I think locally nameless thoughts.
It was time for another attempt at the `covalence` theorem prover, as the end of my PhD loomed. So I
try formalizing the new type theory, this time with cumulative universes and a new approach fusing
locally-nameless style with the indexed term types of
[`logrel-mltt`](https://github.com/mr-ohman/logrel-mltt). At the same time, much meditation on SSA
occurred.

I arrive at Termini Imerese and ride my bike _back_ to Messina, where I stay at the wonderful [La
Badia Bed and Room](https://hotelmania.net/hotel/mesina/la-badia-2/). I arrive at 1 AM, much later
than planned, as I got lost on the way and had to find gas. Thankfully, the owner finds me at the
door and, though I don't have cash, allows me to stay, with a promise to go find an ATM the next
morning and pay.

The owner is a jovial psychiatrist who helps youth with addiction issues, and offers me numerous
coffees. I, of course, accept these, and then head out into the city to find cash and breakfast.
Tempted by the seafood available at the [local
supermarket](https://maps.app.goo.gl/J56836HjAMpBytREA), I decide to stay another night.

I leave the next day, having laid down the bones for what I'm calling [Gödel-Tarski Type
Theory](https://github.com/imbrem/gt3-lean), or GT3, and make for
[Balzano](https://maps.app.goo.gl/dNTWgKJ6aAstbMC36) in Calabria, where my mother's mother's family
lives. There, I receive free food, free board, and poor, but better than shipboard, Internet. And I
also encounter the lowest density of English speakers I've seen in my life, so far. Almost everyone
speaks only Italian.

This provided the perfect environment to get some work done. A little thesis, and a lot of theorem
proving later, and GT3 is taking shape and nearly ready for implementation. I take the time to plan
out my next steps in general. But all good things come to an end, and eventually, it is time to head
northwards, and back to work. To make sure I actually get there on time, I book some sushi with a
good friend of mine in London at 2025-09-19T18:00+1. A precise arrival date does wonders for trip
planning.

I make for Rome, where, carrying what I thought was most of GT3. I get distracted at the gas
station, and the night deepens, so, at 1:30 AM or so, I decide to stop at the neighboring city of
Aquina. As a first shot, I make for (La Vecchia Quercia)[https://maps.app.goo.gl/6xvSN7VuARrSBbXu5],
but I'm too late. Most of the places I call are closed, or expensive, and at this point, being 2:30
AM, I'd be buying just a few hours of quality sleep.

So I decide to do some science and just sleep in the field. It's warm, right.

Verdict: uncomfortable, due to rocks, and the occasional chill. But very doable in Italian summer
weather.

Up, and onwards. My charger is broken, so I need to get a new one. Charging up my navigator before
that in the city, we continue down to Rome, where I plan to meet a friend from Cambridge who's
passing through for a conference. It's a confusing place: all roads lead there, so once you get
there, the roads just lead to themselves, and you're completely free. It's a sad day, when you
understand the quote

> _Freedom is an ocean. You can drown in it._

But there is no victory without sacrifice. It is only through that sadness, that the happiness of
self-actualization, of true freedom, can be reached.

That's what I keep telling myself about graduation, anyways.

I stay at the powerfully-named [Happy Village e Camping
Roma](https://maps.app.goo.gl/YSRQpQdWkDjhKh8U6). After a day of food, sightseeing, and
formalization (I realized that I forgot to add the natural numbers to GT3...), it's time to bounce.

I make for Milan, but _once again_ I fall prey to the temptations of the gas station. So I take a
detour to Bologna, where I hope to meet [Vikraman](https://vikraman.org/), which is always an
excellent experience. Alas, he has left for the UK the _previous day_. Such is fate!

Armed with only his list of recommendations, I translate into the mountains near Bologna, through
freezing mists, and arrive at the [B&B Nina](https://maps.app.goo.gl/UHVus6tCZ3V26iqU9) at 3 AM. The
host is exceedingly hospitable, and, spared from roughing it in the mountains, I fall deep into
hypersleep, gathering strength to face the morrow.

I spend a quiet day working on GT3 and tapping here and there at some locally-nameless SSA ideas.
Night falls once more, and the clock is ticking to return to Cambridge. So I make for Milan once
more, stopping at a local restaurant on the way. And, almost a month later, I find myself once more
at the [Idea Hotel Milano San Siro](https://sansiro.ideahotel.it/).

The sun rises, and I burn rubber on the road to Switzerland. _Elas!_ At the very final gas station
between Italy and Switzerland, I am once more waylaid by that ever crafty opponent, myself! Ah, the
ruses of the French!

A good friend from Toronto and I spend the day there on the phone, discussing `covalence`,
mathematical superintelligence (I am very excited about [https://harmonic.fun/](Harmonic)... we need
to integrate Aristotle with `covalence`, or something...), game theory, and other fun topics.

But then it is 9 PM and the Alps await. And I do not want to bankrupt myself finding a hotel in
Switzerland.

I was so excited to see the Alps in the day. It will have to wait till next time, elas. Through the
inky dark, a point of light flies.

Adventures ensue. I get held up in front of a closed tunnel, and my clutch starts acting up again
(but, thankfully, the bike still works). And so it is nearly 4 AM when, exhausted, I find myself
back in Mulhouse, at the [B&B](https://maps.app.goo.gl/cV1V3x5qh5nuKmiw9) I had originally booked
before the drain plug incident.

The morning comes once more, and I meet with Neel. He's excited about `covalence`, and we discuss
thesis plans. I get some [Indian food](https://maps.app.goo.gl/ZZgyocZV7dTnk5QXA) and ride on over
back to [Seedz Motorsport](https://maps.app.goo.gl/HeNfkWqqq5uGsHKM7) to discuss clutch and refunds.
